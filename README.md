# LocalModelAPI
Python code to set up and test a local API with the downloaded models. 

### Set Up
1. Pull repo into VSCode.
2. Edit the `possible_models` dictionary in the `model_api.py` script to match the availible models on the computer and to potentially edit some of the model paramters (max_tokens, temperature). Might also have to switch the repo IDs to be the model paths to where the models are stored locally.  
3. Run the `model_api.py` script from the terminal to launch the API and select a model when prompted.
4. Test the API with the `test_api.py` script.
5. Quit the API when done.
